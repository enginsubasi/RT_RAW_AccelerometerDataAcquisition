### Real Time RAW Accelerometer Data Acquisition This project working with OpenSTM32 IDE & LabVIEW on STM32F4Discovery board MB997C LIS3DSH.

This project created to help resercher who is working on accelerometer, IMU, INS.

**Firmware**

* You'll connect STM32F4-Discovery via micro -USB connector
* VCP'll running
* STM32F4-Discovery send 3 axis acceleration data to host pc

**LabVIEW**

* Read all data on selected serial connection port
* Plot 3-axis acceleration graph
